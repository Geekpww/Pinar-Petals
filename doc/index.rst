PINAR stands for CLIMate ADAptation and is a probabilistic natural catastrophe impact model, that also calculates averted damage (benefit) thanks to adaptation measures of any kind (from grey to green infrastructure, behavioural, etc.).

PINAR is primarily developed and maintained by the `Weather and Climate Risks Group <https://wcr.ethz.ch/>`_ at `ETH ZÃ¼rich <https://ethz.ch/en.html>`_.

This is the documentation of the PINAR **Petals** module.
Its purpose is generating different types of hazards and more specialized applications than available in the PINAR Core module.

.. attention::

   PINAR Petals builds on top of PINAR Core and is **not** a standalone module.
   Before you start working with Petals, please check out the documentation of the `PINAR Core <https://pinar-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ module, in particular the `installation instructions <https://pinar-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/install.html>`_.
